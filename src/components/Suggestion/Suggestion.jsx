          Famous for its beaches, Goa is the smallest state in India in terms of
          area, the fourth smallest state in terms of the population yet a huge
          contributor to the economy through Goa tourism. Panaji is the capital
          of Goa. Goa Tourism is considered to be the major support to Goa’s
          economy. Through Tripoto’s Goa tourism and travel guide you can
          explore the best of Goa. Thinking of ‘where to go in Goa’? Check out
          the below Goa tour guide and get all the necessary information about
          Goa tourism. When in India’s sunshine state, be prepared to fall in
          love with sandy beaches, palm-fringed shores and beachfront Portuguese
          bungalows. Goa will never fail to entice you with its landscapes
          peppered with paddy fields, coconut groves, windy cliffs and riverside
          forts. While the southern part of the state is a haven for tourists
          seeking quiet days spent by the tranquil seaside, Goa tourism in the
          north is known primarily because of its bustling shacks and legendary
          nightlife. From the umpteen number of places to visit in Goa, a few
          that most definitely shouldn’t be missed are the Fontainhas – India’s
          only existing Latin quarters, the 17th century old Bom Jesus Basilica;
          to revel in a little bohemian spirit, the vibrant Wednesday flea
          market at Anjuna Beach, and Dudhsagar – one of India’s highest
          waterfalls. But if you’re here simply to unwind, there’s no dearth of
          things to enjoy. Starting with spotting a dolphin or two at the
          Palolem beach, marveling at the routinely glorious sunsets at Chapora
          fort, taking leisurely strolls through the mossy ruins of St.
          Augustine in Old Goa or simply soaking in the salty tropical breeze
          with platefuls of butter garlic prawns, bebinca and a few too many rum
          and cokes, with a side of jazz and Konkani music. Wondering how much a
          visit to Goa will cost you? Goa tourism has made it easier for all
          kinds of travellers with a daily budget between Rs.3000 to Rs.5000. If
          your budget is tighter, read on to see what Goa tourism offers to its
          budget travellers and also for a fair breakdown of your expenses in
          Goa.
