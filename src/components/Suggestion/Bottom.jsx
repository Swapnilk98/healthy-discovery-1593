          North Goa is the most famous area of Goa tourism. Known for its
          energetic nightlife, Goan delicacies, flea markets, crowded beaches,
          and shacks, North Goa tops the list. Apart from the enthusiastic crowd
          and pretty shacks, North Goa beaches are also famous for different
          water sports like parasailing, jet skiing, and banana boat rides.
          North Goa is the happy place of Goa as it offers you a variety of
          things to do and a lot of different places to see apart from just

          South Goa is the other half of Goa that offers a tranquil atmosphere
          to its tourists. It is filled with appealing beaches, less crowded
          than the beaches in North Goa. It is a perfect area for a relaxing
          vacation. Though South Goa tourism doesn’t offer as much as the places
          in North Goa do, its calmness and peaceful vibes will make up for
          everything. South Goa beaches are much whiter and cleaner than the
          beaches in North Goa and Goa tourism has gradually picked up here.
          Cotigao wildlife sanctuary, Cabo de Rama Fort and Dudhsagar falls are
          some of the must-visit places in South Goa.
